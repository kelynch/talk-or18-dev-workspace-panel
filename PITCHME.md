## Docker for development

* Dockerized services as shared components

* Terminology:
  * Docker - software automation platform
  * Image - snapshot of an application that can be consistently deployed
  * Container - An instance of a Docker image
  * Dockerfile - code file to build Docker images
  * docker-compose - tool for defining and deploying multi-container applications

* Reducing toil by automating repetitive operations tasks
* Greater parity

* Enforces reproducibility
  * Greatly reduces inconsistency
  * Narrows focus in troubleshooting
